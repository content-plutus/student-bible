# Documentation Home

The `/docs` directory houses project-facing documentation. Start here to find the right guide for each workflow.

## Index

- `supabase-project-setup.md` – step-by-step guide for provisioning and linking the shared Supabase project.
- `architecture/` – high-level solution design, diagrams, and component responsibilities (placeholder).
- `schema/` – database schema specifications, migration logs, and validation matrices (placeholder).
- `processes/` – operational runbooks (sync schedules, incident response, QA checklists) (placeholder).
- `playbooks/` – how-to guides for common tasks (data import, schema extensions, export workflows) (placeholder).

## Contribution Tips

1. Add new docs inside the relevant subfolder; create more sections if the existing ones don’t fit.
2. Keep filenames descriptive and use Markdown headings to keep navigation consistent.
3. Submit documentation changes via PR alongside the related code changes so they stay in sync with the implementation.
