# **Core Goal:** 
Create a unified "Student Bible" - a centralized data management system that aggregates student information from multiple touchpoints into a single source of truth.

### **Key Data Collection Touchpoints:**

1. **Initial Enrollment/Onboarding** - Credit risk assessment (installment payments), user personas/profiles (registration+ book delivery addresses + MSU data required by company for tax exemptions)
2. **Pre-Exam Registration** - Intent data & Self-assessment (who's planning to take which exam and when) + actual assessment (mock test data)
3. **Post-Exam Feedback** - Self-assessment, confidence levels, perceived performance
4. **Post-Results** - Actual outcomes, gap analysis between expectations vs. reality

#### **What the "Bible" Should Show:**

- Complete student profile and background
- Enrollment history (which certifications)
- Reparation tracking (attendance and test scores)
- Exam attempt history (how many taken, how many passed)
- Current progress tracking (e.g., 2/13 papers completed)
- Journey stage visualization
