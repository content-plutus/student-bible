# Student Bible

Centralized data management system for tracking every student touchpoint across enrollment, mentorship, exams, and certification outcomes. The goal is to provide internal teams with one reliable place to search for a student, inspect their progress, and export data for reporting.

## Repository Contents

- `tasks/0001-prd-student-bible.md` – Product Requirements Document describing scope, constraints, and success measures.
- `tasks/tasks-0001-prd-student-bible.md` – Detailed task breakdown derived from the PRD.
- `create-prd.md` / `generate-tasks.md` – Prompt templates used to create and refine the PRD/task list.

## Next Steps

1. Finalize tech stack decision (Supabase + Next.js recommended in PRD).
2. Stand up project scaffolding and database schema.
3. Work through the task list incrementally, validating output against the PRD.
